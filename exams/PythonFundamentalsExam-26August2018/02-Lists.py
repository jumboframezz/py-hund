# Problem 2. Lists
# Input / Constraints
# You will be given a single lines of elements(integers), separated with one or more spaces. You should check if all
# elements in the line are unique. If they are you should increase the value of every even element with the number of
# 2 and print the list on single row in ascending order separated by ",".
# If they are not unique you should increase every odd element with the number of 3 and print them on single row,
# separated with ":"
# On the next line you should print sum of the all elements divided by the count of the elements in the list. You should
# do that until you receive the command "stop playing"
# Output
# If the elements are unique
# Unique list: {elements in the list, separated by “,”}
# Output: {sum of all elements divided by the length of the list}
# Else
# Non-unique list: {elements in the list, separated by “:”}
# Output: {sum of all elements divided by the length of the list}
