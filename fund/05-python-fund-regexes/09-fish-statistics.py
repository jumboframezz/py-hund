Problem 09. Fish Statistics

You are a marine biologist tasked with researching various types of fish. You will receive a single line on the
console as input. From this line, you must extract all the fish you find and print statistics about each one.
Fish are categorized by three criteria: tail length, body length and status. A standard fish looks like this:

><(((('>


This fish has a tail length of 1, a body length of 4 and has the status "Awake", since its eye is open.
One ASCII character represents 2 centimeters in real life. By those standards, this fish has a tail length of 2 cm
and a body length of 8 cm. There are various types of tails, bodies and statuses, which are described below:

Tail types:

Tail longer than 5 "<" characters  Long
Tail longer than 1 "<" characters  Medium
Tail, which is 1 "<" character long  Short
Nonexistent tail  None

Body types:
Body longer than 10 "(" characters  Long
Body longer than 5 "(" characters  Medium
Any other length  Short

Statuses:

'  Awake
-  Asleep
x  Dead

The input will contain a variable amount of fish, separated by any sequence of ASCII characters. There's a
possibility you might receive input, which has no fish â€“ in this case, just print "No fish found.", and end the program.
